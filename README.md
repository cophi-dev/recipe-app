To build this website I used React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 


## Features

<!-- TODO: List what specific 'user problems' that this application solves. -->
This website is part of my portfolio website [https://phillipp.eu]. You can use this website to search for a recipe or simply browse popular and/or veggie or national cuisines. After you click on a recipe, you get to the description page, where you get every information on what is needed to cook the meal and how to prepare it. The website is fully response and easy to use.

## Acknowledgements

The basis for this project was provided by a DevEd react tutorial. I learned a lot about the basics of React components and API calls.

<!-- TODO: List any blog posts, tutorials or plugins that you may have used to complete the project. Only list those that had a significant impact. Obviously, we all 'Google' stuff while working on our things, but maybe something in particular stood out as a 'major contributor' to your skill set for this project. -->
